# Spending Tracker

## This Python project creates a pie chart based on entered spending.

The idea behind this project is to extract data from a CSV file, format it and display a pie chart 
that has slices for each category of spending, including total amount and percentage of the whole. 


How to run the project locally:
1. Download the project on your PC. 
2. Ensure the used Python version is Python 3.9.
3. Install the Matplotlib library by typing in the terminal 'pip install Matplotlib'.
4. Run the project.

As things stand, the information upon which the pie chart is created is static. This means that data needs to be manually 
added in the CSV file. Further down the line, this will be changed to ensure seamless usage.
