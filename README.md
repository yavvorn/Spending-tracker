# Spending Tracker

## This Python project creates a pie chart based on entered spending.

The idea behind this project is to extract data from a CSV file, format it and display a pie chart 
that has slices for each category of spending, including total amount and percentage of the whole. 


How to run the project locally:
1. Download the project on your PC.
2. Open the project through PyCharm.
3. To run the project, the user must activate activate the dependency manager - Poetry. This is done by first installing poetry to the virtual environment by typing '-pip install poetry' in the terminal.
4. Once Poetry is installed, the user has to type 'poetry install' in the terminal. This command reads the .toml file from the project, resolves the dependencies, and installs them.
7. Run the project.

As things stand, the information upon which the pie chart is created is static. This means that data needs to be manually 
added in the CSV file. Further down the line, this will be changed to ensure seamless usage.
